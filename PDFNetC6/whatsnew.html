	<h2>New In This Release</h2>
	<h3>Version 11.5 is primarily a bugfix release.</h3>
	<h3>New Features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added support for Word 2003 XML document format.</li>
		<li>Added to the Optimizer the API function RemoveDuplicateStreams() which can be called separately without doing any other optimization changes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>New Options</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added new API function FillTemplateJsonToOfficeWithFilter.  The behavior is the same as FillTemplateJsonToOffice, except it writes to a filter instead of a file.</li>
		<li>Added new API function HTML2PDF.SetSandbox() to disable process sandboxing in HTML2PDF, which could be necessary for Azure App Services on Windows.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>End of support</h3>

The error is now replaced with a silent warning log, in line with how other PDF viewer applications handle these corruptions.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved the parsing of corrupt PDFs that contain invalid circular references inside an xref table. Previously, we could skip parsing some corrupt objects, which could lead to errors such as &quot;[function] can&apos;t be invoked on Obj of this type&quot;.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved the performance of PDFDoc.GetGeometryCollectionForPage().</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Deprecated the HasNext() function in the dictionary iterator and replaced it with the more accurately named HasCurrent().</li>

	<h2>New In This Release</h2>
	<h3>PDF/UA-1 Conversion</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A new experimental interface to automatically convert and add accessible tags to existing PDF files so that they conform to PDF/UA-1. (PDFUAConformance class and PDFUAConformance.AutoConvert())</li>
		<li>This autoconversion feature requires that DataExtractionModule be present and accessible from the SDK.</li>
		<li>Note that for full conformance with PDF/UA it is required that the generated output undergo manual review and editing as required.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Barcode Module</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added a new Barcode Module that can detect a wide range of barcode types in PDF files and provides output in JSON format. (BarcodeModule.ExtractBarcodes() or BarcodeModule.ExtractBarcodesAsString())</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>New Options</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added an option to export comments from Word documents as PDF annotations. (OfficeToPDFOptions.SetDisplayComments())</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Improvements:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[ocr]</b> The latest OCR module has significantly improved quality and run speed.</li>
		<li><b>[.net]</b> Added support for .NET 9.</li>
		<li><b>[cad]</b> Updated CAD module binaries to use ODA version 25.8.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved the exception message in TextSearch.Run() for when the search string is empty. Previously it could throw a "The instance hasn't been initialized yet." exception.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Reduced the memory required when loading PDF files with static XFA containing element names that are split into many parts. Previously loading these files could lead to very high memory usage.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved support for parsing corrupt PDF files containing TJ operators where the operator argument has an extra unmatched left square bracket. Previously, rendering a file with this error could lead to missing text or other content.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved support for rendering corrupt PDFs where there is an unexpected operator "n" within a text block. Previously this could cause words to incorrectly overlap with each other.</li>
		<li><b>[cad]</b> When converting CAD to PDF hidden layers will now be retained.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved handling of corrupt PDF files with invalid path building commands in BT/ET blocks. Previously this could lead to rendering errors including incorrectly positioned text elements.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved handling for corrupt PDF files containing garbage data after trailers or inconsistent trailer dictionaries. Previously, such files could fail to load with an "Attempt to load free object" exception.</li>
		<li><b>[pdfa]</b> Conversion to PDF/A-1 with transparency flattening enabled now supports flattening partially transparent text. Previously this text could become opaque after conversion.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Adjusted PDF incremental download to more efficiently fetch document info which can be required for rendering.</li>
		<li><b>[cad]</b> Added support for using embedded DWF fonts on Linux. Previously, missing this support could cause incorrect glyphs or glyph spacing in the output.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Bugfixes:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed an issue where files with fields that have JavaScript actions containing whitespace-only values were being calculated incorrectly. Previously this could result in unexpected changes to unrelated field values.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed an error where font styles (e.g., Bold, Italic) may fail to be applied during Freetext annotation appearance generation if they are supplied via the annotation's default resources (DR) dictionary.</li>
		<li><b>[pdfa]</b> Fixed an issue with conversions to PDF/A-2 or higher which could occasionally lead to relevant characters mapped to glyph index 0 (the .notdef glyph) being removed from the content.</li>
		<li><b>[pdfa]</b> Fixed an issue with conversions to PDF/A-2 or higher where the output file could have a validation error: "tintTransform is different in Separations with the same colorant name is not fixed in the output file", or a similar error for alternateSpace.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed an issue with redacting rare PDF text that uses fonts with inaccurate or broken geometry information. Previously this could cause some text to be erroneously redacted or missed during redaction.</li>
		<li><b>[pdfa]</b> Fixed an issue with PDF/A conversion, where the output file would have a validation error: "Corrupt content stream". This can happen on input files that are generated by merging different pdfs.</li>

	<h2>New In This Release</h2>
	<h3>Version 10.11 is primarily a bugfix release.</h3>
	<h2>New Options</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Added an option for PDFDoc.MergeXFDF() to support nonstandard rotations (that are not a multiple of 90) when generating annotation appearances. This can be necessary to generate appearances that match how annotations are displayed in WebViewer. (MergeXFDFOptions.SetUseNonStandardRotation())</li>
		<li>Added options for conversion from PDF to Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and HTML (in e_reflow_full mode) that adjust how headers, footers and footnotes should be handled in the output. Options include removing them, including them as normal content, or recovering them as headers, footers, or footnotes. (SetDetectAndRemoveHeadersAndFooters() and SetDetectAndRemoveFootnotes() in WordOutputOptions, PowerPointOutputOptions, ExcelOutputOptions and HTMLOutputOptions)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Improvements:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[xps]</b> Significantly improved PDF to XPS conversion performance when handling unmodified PDF documents with many annotations.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved support for loading corrupt password protected PDF files with an incorrectly long Perms entry. Previously the password would not be accepted.</li>

		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Base14 fonts are now created without an unnecessary Encoding entry when the font is not embedded. This can improve the display of check box appearances generated by the SDK in some PDF viewers.</li>
		<li><b>[java]</b> Added support for usage of a predefined tmpdir 'com.pdftron.systemloadtmpdir' rather than the default 'java.io.tmpdir'. This provides an alternative way to load the library when the user path contains Unicode characters that can prevent Java's System.load() from working.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved support for rendering broken Type0 fonts that come with no Registry/Ordering information. Previously this could lead to unexpected characters being rendered.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Bugfixes:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed an uncommon issue with nested fields when merging XFDF to PDF. Previously the field content would not be merged to the PDF.</li>
		<li><b>[ocr]</b> Fixed a rare issue related to the IRIS OCR module when unusually large pages exceeded maximum pixel limitations. Previously OCR could fail with error 'Image side [...] out of limits. Max: 32768 in SetImage()' or could quietly not detect any words.</li>
		<li><b>[xps]</b> Fixed an issue when converting from PDF to XPS where text or paths formed by many thin lines could have spiky shapes around the edges (caused by extended miter joins) in the resulting XPS file. </li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed a crash when deleting a specific type of corrupt PDF after ElementBuilder.CreateForm(Page) was used.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed a divide by 0 crash which could occur when rendering some PDF files containing images of 0 width or height.</li>

		<li><b>[java]</b> Fixed an issue where a Java TimestampingConfiguration object would become invalid after a call to TestConfiguration(), causing subsequent usages of the object to crash.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed a memory leak that could occur when using Font methods to create a new font multiple times from the same path or memory buffer.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed a crash in FreeText appearance generation that would occur when the rich text entry was corrupt and missing the `&lt;body&gt;` element.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed a potential issue with FreeText appearance generation where some of the glyphs close to the top of the annotation could be cut off, particularly accents.</li>
		<li><b>[image]</b> Fixed a memory leak that could occur during conversion from TIFF to PDF with Convert.StreamingPDFConversion() or Convert.UniversalConversion().</li>
		<li><b>[node.js]</b> Added a few OfficeToPDFOptions functions missing from Node.js.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed issues with the functions Widget.GetTextColor(), Widget.GetFontSize() and Widget.GetFont() where the default appearance would not be inherited from parent fields. Previously they could incorrectly return a default value instead (black text color, font size 0, and Helvetica).</li>
		<li><b>[pdfa]</b> Fixed an issue where certain types of pushbutton appearances could be missing after converting to PDF/A.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed an error refreshing FreeText annotations on Linux where we could fail to find system fonts with spaces in their names (e.g., "Times New Roman"). </li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed an issue with redaction of vector graphics defined clipping paths that are completely enclosed in the redaction area. Previously this could lead to invisible content becoming visible in rare cases.</li>
		<li><b>[cad]</b> Fixed an issue where the DWG model pages defined in a specific way could be missing from the output PDF.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed an issue with PDFDoc.FlattenAnnotations() when handling hidden or invisible annotations. Previously the annotations could become visible after flattening.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed a crash that would occur when flattening or converting to XOD extremely uncommon and complex pages, with over 10,485,760 elements.</li>
		<li><b>[pdfa]</b> PDF/A conversion will now skip creating empty appearance streams when not required. Previously this could wipe out the borders of Link annots for any PDF/A conformance level, and the appearance of non-Widget annots when converting to PDF/A-1.</li>
		<li><b>[.net]</b> Fixed an issue where calling function Markup.SetTitle() with a non-ASCII string in .Net Core/Standard/5/6/7/8 would lead to a mangled annotation title.</li>
		<li><b>[cad]</b> Fixed an error that occurred only when converting specific DGN files to PDF on Linux. Previously an "Error converting CAD content using CAD2PDF module Add-On." exception could be thrown.</li>
		<li><b>[html]</b> Fixed issues with the HTML2PDF options HTML2PDF.SetLandscape(), HTML2PDF.SetPaperSize() and HTML2PDF.SetPrintBackground(). Previously these could be ignored.</li>
		<li><b>[html]</b> Fixed an issue with handling double quotes around attribute values in HTML2PDF.SetHeader() or HTML2PDF.SetFooter(). Previously an exception with message "An internal error happened between the SDK and the HTML2PDF module. Contact Apryse support for assistance." would be thrown.</li>

	<h2>New In This Release</h2>
	<h3>Version 10.1 is primarily a bugfix release.</h3>
	<h3>New Options</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added an option to adjust the order in which pages are displayed after CAD to PDF conversion. (CADConvertOptions.SetLayoutSortOrder())</li>
		<li>Added support for custom font mappings in CAD to PDF conversion. (refer to  https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/core/guides/features/conversion/convert-cad-to-pdf/#fonts for details)</li>
		<li>Added an option to output a log file for HTML to PDF conversion. (HTML2PDF.SetLogFilePath())</li>
		<li>Added an option to set a preferred OCR engine for PDF to Office conversion. (WordOutputOptions.SetPreferredOCREngine(), ExcelOutputOptions.SetPreferredOCREngine(), PowerPointOutputOptions.SetPreferredOCREngine())</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Changed Behaviour:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> .Net 4 builds now depend on the Visual Studio 2015-2022 redistributable instead of the Visual Studio 2013 redistributable.</li>
		<li> Captions on line annotations will now be black by default and otherwise will use the color of the RC entry. Previously this text would be created using the same color as the line.</li>
		<li> Page manipulation operations and ElementWriter.Begin() are now part of the Base consumption licensing package.</li>
		<li> Adjusted the resolution of floating point numbers in XFDF export to 0.0001. Previously these numbers were emitted with a fixed number of significant digits, which could result in varying precision, depending on the size of the number.</li>
		<li> HTML2PDF.Convert() will now always throw an exception rather than return false if there is an error. Previously this behaviour was inconsistent. (Version 10.1.1 Hotfix)</li>
		<li> HTML2PDF.GetLog() will now return the contents of the log file produced by the module rather than a short error message. This shorter message will be included as part of the exception. (Version 10.1.1 Hotfix)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Improvements:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[cad]</b> Significantly improved error handling for the CAD module to help with diagnosis of common errors.</li>
		<li><b>[html]</b> Significantly improved error messages for the HTML2PDF module to help with diagnosis of common errors.</li>

	<h2>New In This Release</h2>
	<h3>Version 10.0</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>With version 10.0, Apryse SDK now shares a version number with WebViewer, and the two products will now be kept in sync.</li>
		<li>Previously the core WebViewer engine could lag behind the SDK release by some time. Going forward that will no longer be the case, and bugfixes in this changelog will be in WebViewer as well (where applicable).</li>
		<li>Future releases will also come at a quicker cadence, with a new official release every 6 weeks.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Document Layout Engine (<b>BETA</b>)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Construct reflowable text content in the style of your choosing using the new FlowDocument class. Text will wrap automatically within the allowed bounds, and will flow onto subsequent pages.</li>
		<li>Many more features on the way: tables, lists, sections, column layout, advanced typographic features, .etc.</li>
		<li>While we do not anticipate any major changes, be aware that this is a beta API, and there may be some minor breaking changes to the interface in subsequent releases.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Text Diff Additions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added an option to text diff which can remove placeholders that show where content was inserted into or removed from the other document. (TextDiffOptions.SetShowPlaceHolders())</li>
		<li>Added options to text diff to allow for highlighting short-distance moves and adjusting the appearance of these highlights. (TextDiffOptions.SetExtraMoveHighlight(), TextDiffOptions.SetExtraMoveColor(), TextDiffOptions.SetExtraMoveOpacity())</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Other Changes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added new option for HTML to PDF Conversion to allow it to work in environments with limited platform dependencies, such as AWS Lambda. (HTML2PDF.SetCompatibilityMode()) Note that this option uses altered graphics options and does not create a dedicated render process, which may lead to some performance degradation.</li>
		<li>Added an option to disable all external fetches during markdown conversions. (ConversionOptions.SetEnableExternalMediaDownloads())</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Improvements:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[all]</b> Adjusted the SDK on Arm64 Linux to use more compatible versions of GLIBC functions. This allows it to work on more Linux distributions including Amazon Linux 2.</li>

		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Avoid throwing exception on Annot.Flatten() if the widget annotation has an AP entry even if it is missing the required FT entry. Previously these corrupt annotations could fail to flatten.</li>	
		<li><b>[xfdf]</b> When exporting XFDF ignore corrupt Contents entries that are not of type String. Previously this would cause an exception to be thrown.</li>
		<li><b>[xfdf]</b> Adjusted XFDFExport to provide a font string from DA even if this font cannot be found in the document.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Bugfixes:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[xfdf]</b> Fixed a crash that could occur on Measure dictionaries with missing ViewPort when exporting XFDF.</li>

		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Digital Signature Validation now allows OCSP responses if revocation time is after reference time if the status was superseded. Previously these documents would fail to validate, which mismatches with other PDF consumers.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed a crash that could occur when using linearized save on specific corrupt documents if the document was edited in specific ways.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Fixed an out of bounds crash that could occur in rare cases during text comparison.</li>

	<h2>New Features:</h2>
	<h3>Data Extraction Module</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A collection of routines for intelligently extracting data from PDFs: infer document structure from document content, extract data in tabular form, and  detect interactive regions on a page.</li>
		<li>Extract the underlying document structure in JSON form, yielding the position and content of paragraphs, tables and other structural elements. (DataExtractionModule.ExtractData(), using the e_DocStructure engine)</li>
		<li>Use the tabular extraction engine to accurately extract data from your document in the form of tables, producing output in either JSON or XLSX form. (DataExtractionModule.ExtractData(), DataExtractionModule.ExtractToXLSX())</li>
		<li>The form extraction engine can be used to recognize interactive elements on a page visually, so that the correct associated PDF annotations can be created. (DataExtractionModule.ExtractData() using the e_Form engine)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>SVG to PDF Conversion</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added new built-in conversion from SVG to PDF. (Convert.FromSVG() and as part of Convert.ToPdf())</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>New Features:</h2>
	<h3>Digital Signature Verification</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Major improvements to MDP (Modification, Detection and Permissions) support.</li>
		<li>Added an option which can be used to reduce the running time of Digital Signature Verification on certain PDF files. (VerificationOptions.SetRevocationTimeout()) This should be used carefully as too low a timeout could lead to trust verification failures.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>New Package-Based License Keys</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added support for new package-based license keys which group existing permissions into fewer simpler categories. One type of these new keys can be used for consumption-based licensing.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>HTML2PDF Extensions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Added an option to HTML to PDF conversion that allows the user to specify one or more cookies to use when loading. (HTML2PDF.AddCookie())</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Other Changes</h3>
	<ul>

	</ul>
		
	<h2>Changed Behaviour:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Java X501AttributeTypeAndValue.getAttributeTypeOID now correctly returns ObjectIdentifier rather than long. </li>
		<li>Java ObjectIdentifier integer constants were removed, since there is no way to use them properly.</li>
		<li>Java ObjectIdentifier.Predefined enum names were adjusted to remove the unnecessary ObjectIdentifier_ prefix.</li>
	</ul>

	<A href="#void" target="_self" onClick="ToggleMenu(v910_btn, v910_cnt);"><strong>Version 9.1.0 - August 24th, 2021</strong></A>
	<div style="display:none;margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px;" id="v910_cnt">
	<h1 style="font-size: 12pt;">New Features</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>PDFTron Web Services (PWS) support to allow for pay-as-you-go licensing on Windows, Linux and Mac.</li>
		<li>Advanced imaging: Added support for HEIF/HEIC formats (native to iOS devices), as well as camera raw formats for Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Minolta, Fuji, Sony, and Kodak cameras.</li>
		<li>Added new custom signing API. (DigitalSignatureField.CalculateDigest(), DigitalSignatureField.CreateSigDictForCustomSigning/Certification(), PDFDoc.SaveWithCustomSignature()) This is especially helpful for cases where the signing step needs to be done separately such as Hardware Security Module (HSM) workflows.</li>
		<li>Added support for embedding digital signature timestamps in CMS. (GenerateContentsWithEmbeddedTimestamp() and custom signing APIs).</li>
		<li>Added an API to sign a signature digest outside of the PDF document. (DigitalSignatureField.SignDigest()).</li>
		<li>Added support for exporting and importing PDF custom appearances in XFDF in a way that is largely compatible with other PDF processors. These appearances can be generated using XFDFExportOptions.SetWriteAnnotationAppearance(true). Appearances are also now shared this way during realtime collaboration.</li>
		<li>PDFDoc.AppendTextDiff now supports optional exclusion zones. (TextDiffOptions.AddIgnoreZonesForPage()).</li>
	</ul>
	<h1 style="font-size: 12pt;">Changed Behaviour</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Apryse SDK on desktop platforms now requires a license key. A demo/evaluation key can be found at https://www.pdftron.com/pws/get-key.</li>

		<li>C++ PDFViewCtrl was removed from the base C++ package, since its dependencies made it incompatible with Azure Functions. It is still available as part of a separate package.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1 style="font-size: 12pt;">Other Changes</h1>

	<h4 id="improvements">Improvements</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[Node.js]</b> Added support for Node 15 and 16 to npm.</li>
		<li><b>[Python]</b> Added support for Python 3.9 to pip.</li>
		<li><b>[MacOS]</b> Added support for MacOS to PDF2HtmlReflowParagraphs and PDF2Word conversion.</li>
		<li><b>[MacOS]</b> Added support for Apple Silicon (arm64) slice in Apryse SDK Python3 pip package and Node.js npm package.</li>
		<li><b>[Node.js]</b> Various extraneous items, such as documentation and samples were removed from the npm packages by default. This makes the package smaller and more practical to use in serverless functions.</li>
		<li><b>[Node.js]</b> A number of improvements or additions to the Node API and documentation.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Significant performance improvements for AppendTextDiff.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Extending XRef parsing logic to handle corrupt cases where initial XRef entries are not defined.</li>		
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Added logic into Linearized save to prevent binary inconsistencies between runs.</li>	
		<li><b>[C++]</b> Adjusted PDFNet::Terminate to allow for the library to be initialized again later. Previously this flow was not supported.</li>
		<li><b>[MacOS]</b> Adjusted minimum MacOS support for the SDK to 10.7. (was 10.15).</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Taking shading usage better into account when making the decision to flatten. Previously it was possible to have a large number of shadings, but have the file not be flattened.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> On signed PDF documents incremental save will now write exactly the same format (including the number of decimal places) for numbers that were not changed. This can help to prevent invalidation of existing signatures in rare cases where relevant numbers need to be re-written.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improvement to Obj.IsFree() to return false rather than throw an exception if the object is direct.</li>
		<li><b>[jpeg]</b> Added support for extracting embedded ICC Profiles in JPEG images and embedding them in the PDF. This mainly appears as more correct colors in the output image.</li>
		<li><b>[html]</b> Various improvements and extensions to reflowable HTML support including integration with PDFTron.AI and the inclusion of document images.</li>
		<li><b>[windows]</b> Removed dependency on newer versions of Windows. This dependency was removed because it prevented the SDK from running on Windows 7 and older versions of the OS.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Various improvements to realtime collaboration support.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Improved the reading order of text extraction when processing tables.</li>
		<li><b>[pdf]</b> Adjusted Optimizer to throw out resources on a page basis rather than a document basis. While this doesn't automatically shrink the documents it produces smaller output when the optimized file is split.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h4>
